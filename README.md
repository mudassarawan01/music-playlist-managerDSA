# music-playlist-manager
🎵 Music Playlist Manager – C++ DSA Project
A console-based music playlist management system developed as a 4th-semester Data Structures & Algorithms project at IIUI. The project demonstrates the use of core data structures and algorithms including linked lists, hash maps, sorting, and searching — all manually implemented in C++.

🧠 Features
Add, delete, and view songs in a playlist

Sort songs by title using:

Bubble Sort

Merge Sort

Search songs using:

Linear Search

HashMap Lookup

Doubly linked list for playlist storage

Hash table for fast title-based song lookup

Performance comparison using chrono timers

Console-based user interface

💻 Technologies
Language: C++

Compiler: Dev-C++ / g++ (C++98 compatible)

Concepts: OOP, Linked List, Hash Table, Sorting & Searching Algorithms

📚 Data Structures Used
Structure	Purpose
Song class	Stores individual song data
Node class	Doubly linked list node
LinkedList	Stores the entire playlist
HashMap	Fast lookup by song title

🧪 Algorithms Used
Algorithm	Type	Use Case
Linear Search	Searching	Brute-force search by title
Hash Lookup	Searching	Fast lookup via custom hash map
Bubble Sort	Sorting	Simple sort by song title
Merge Sort	Sorting	Efficient sort by song title


📊 Performance Snapshot
Operation	Time (µs)	Method
Search Song	160	Linear Search
Search Song	12	Hash Lookup
Sort Playlist	830	Bubble Sort
Sort Playlist	142	Merge Sort
