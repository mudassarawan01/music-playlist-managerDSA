# music-playlist-manager
ðŸŽµ Music Playlist Manager â€“ C++ DSA Project

A console-based music playlist management system developed as a 4th-semester Data Structures & Algorithms project at IIUI. The project demonstrates the use of core data structures and algorithms including linked lists, hash maps, sorting, and searching â€” all manually implemented in C++.

ðŸ§  Features

Add, delete, and view songs in a playlist

Sort songs by title using:

Bubble Sort

Merge Sort

Search songs using:

Linear Search

HashMap Lookup

Doubly linked list for playlist storage

Hash table for fast title-based song lookup

Performance comparison using chrono timers

Console-based user interface

ðŸ’» Technologies
Language: C++

Compiler: Dev-C++ / g++ (C++98 compatible)

Concepts: OOP, Linked List, Hash Table, Sorting & Searching Algorithms

ðŸ“š Data Structures Used

Structure	Purpose
Song class	Stores individual song data
Node class	Doubly linked list node
LinkedList	Stores the entire playlist
HashMap	Fast lookup by song title

ðŸ§ª Algorithms Used

Algorithm	Type	Use Case
Linear Search	Searching	Brute-force search by title
Hash Lookup	Searching	Fast lookup via custom hash map
Bubble Sort	Sorting	Simple sort by song title
Merge Sort	Sorting	Efficient sort by song title


ðŸ“Š Performance Snapshot

Operation	Time (Âµs)	Method
Search Song	160	Linear Search
Search Song	12	Hash Lookup
Sort Playlist	830	Bubble Sort
Sort Playlist	142	Merge Sort
